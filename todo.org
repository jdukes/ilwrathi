* Add doctest and unittest
* token analyzer
** calc entropy per char
** entropy of string
** relevance <- what's the word?
   given potential sample size, what is the probability that the
   sample matches population?
* automate race condition testing
* add data models
** think about data modeling syntax
* add fuzzing mixin
* add cross user base class
* add client base classes
* add crypto module
* add unit test mixin
  make automated tests generated from unit test framework. Generate
  code? Must define fail cases differently for different clients.
* calc reigonal entropy to highlight areas that are changing
  use parser to break request/responses in to reigions. generate
  entropy heat map visualization
* write spring parser that greps code base for @RequestMapping and such
